To assess the performance of the proposed system, experiment was performed to ensure that it performs well. 
The experiment was performed using 50 images captured using the camera with various obstacle position and distances. The images were 
divided into 19 images with no obstacles and 31 images with obstacle. Experiment result show that the obstacle detection module provide a 
very satisfactory result with 100% precision and 100% recall.  The 31 images with obstacle were then divided into 25 training images and 6 testing 
images. The training images were used to create the RANSAC model that describes the relationship between the distance of the obstacle and the distance
 of the laser blob. The testing images are then used to measure the error between the prediction distance and the actual distance. The error of each 
 image is described in Table 1. From the experiments, it can be concluded that our system performs very satisfactorily with average error of 1.706 cm. 
 The RANSAC method showed a better performance than the Linear Regression result which is showed average error of 2.508 cm.  The last module, the navigation
 system, also show a very satisfactory result with 100% accuracy of movement. The wheelchair was navigated quickly and correctly in real time responding to 
 the obstacles appearance on the pathway.  B. Human Tracking Subsystem Evaluation To evaluate performance of the proposed method for tracking human guide u
 nder unstable lighting and background environment , we used accuracy method [19]. The testing scenario are based on the number of frames which contains a 
guide detected by HOG and the number of frames which contains guide sequentially detected by HOG and EDM as a powerful method for detection and tracking.
In the current work, we have developed smart wheelchair system which is equipped with obstacle detection and human tracking algorithm based on computer vision.
 We mounted a camera placed in front of the wheelchair and a line laser which is aimed toward the obstacle. Later, the pattern of captured image of the line 
 laser will be calculated using RANSAC method to estimate the distance and the position of the obstacle. For the human tracking part, HOG is applied on the 
 image sequence containing human as guide. After having a certain frame that contains guide area using HOG, the specific feature of the area that can be 
 extracted using entropy. In this study, we use the upper third part of detected block from HOG detection, which is extracted from a third of height and width,
 respectively. The experiment result of obstacle distance estimation using RANSAC showed lower average error, which is only 1.076 cm compared to linear 
 regression which is 2.508 cm. The average accuracy of human guide detecting algorithm also showed acceptable result, which yield over 80% of accuracy.
